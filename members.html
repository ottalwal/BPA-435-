            <h2>About Stage Freight</h2>
            <p>
                We're Stage Fright, and we're here to turn up the volume and leave you breathless. We're not about polished perfection; we're about the raw energy, the sweat, the grit, and the feeling of a live show that hits you right in the chest. <br>
                <br>
                We're a four-piece powerhouse and we're on a mission to bring real rock and roll back to the front lines. We're not afraid to get loud, to get a little messy, and to leave it all on the stage. We're not just playing music; we're creating an experience.

            <h2>How We Got Started</h2>
            <p>It all started in a garage, the kind where the amps are probably louder than they should be, and the neighbors are either complaining or secretly enjoying the show. We met at a local band's show where we realized we all had a shared need - to create some noise. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Ha Ben had the killer riffs, and Owen was laying down the heavy basslines. It was when Tamara started screaming into the mic that we knew something was clicking and we needed to get to the next level. Then, Baslel's drum beat just blew us all away and we realized we had something truly special together. <br><br>
                We spent so many nights writing, playing, and arguing (that's how you know it's real, right?). We weren't trying to be anything we weren't, you know? That first live show? Terrifying. But that's when we knew what we wanted to be called: Stage Fright.
